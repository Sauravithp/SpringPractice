# Array:
Array is a collection of similar type of elements  that are referred  by a common name. It is an object that contains element of similar datatype. It is an index based starting from 0.But array has one limitation i.e we can store data only in limited space and it cannot grow its size during runtime.Thus, to solve this issue java has provided a framework  called collection that consists of various interfaces and classes used as array which can grow as per requirement.

One of the class used extensively is ArrayList that implements List interface. It provides us dynamic arrays having many useful methods that are:

-	add()
It is used to add data to the arraylist.

-	get()
It is used to access the data stored in the list.

-	set()
It is used to modify the data stored in the list.

-	remove()
It is used to delete the data that the list contains.

-	size()
It is used to determine the total number of data that the list contains.

It  has many other methods that makes the data storing  flexible.

In the addded code, a crud application is developed using the ArrayList to store, retrive , update and deletethe data added by the user.
